The London Python Dojo is a regular meetup of Pythonistas where we meetup and learn about Python in a safe and friendly environment. Sometimes we run workshops, sometimes we hack on code, sometimes we do lightning talks, but one thing is for sure - we always have fun! All skill levels welcome!

We run our regular dojo on the 1st Thursday of every month (except August). Sign up to the `mailing list <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-uk>`_ or follow us on `Twitter <https://twitter.com/#!/ldnpydojo>`_ to keep informed.
